# HappySkills Conventions — Skill Authoring Supplement

HappySkills is a **superset** of the Claude Code skill spec. A HappySkills-managed skill has both:

- `SKILL.md` — Claude Code standard (how Claude interprets the skill)
- `skill.json` — HappySkills standard (how skills are packaged, versioned, and distributed)

This file covers everything HappySkills adds on top of the Claude Code spec.

---

## 1. Content Opacity Principle

| Aspect | Owned By | File |
|---|---|---|
| How Claude interprets the skill | Claude Code | `SKILL.md` |
| How the skill is packaged, versioned, and distributed | HappySkills | `skill.json` |

HappySkills **never parses** SKILL.md frontmatter or content. All packaging decisions come from `skill.json`. The two specs evolve independently.

---

## 2. skill.json Manifest

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Lowercase, hyphens/underscores allowed. Must start with letter or digit. Pattern: `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$/` |
| `version` | string | Valid semver (e.g., `0.1.0`, `1.2.3`). New skills start at `0.1.0`. |

### Optional Type Field

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | `"skill"` (default) or `"kit"`. Omitting the field is equivalent to `"skill"`. |

A **kit** is a dependency manifest — a skill whose value comes entirely from its `dependencies` list. Kits bundle a curated set of skills that install together. Key differences from regular skills:

- Kit SKILL.md has **no frontmatter** (plain markdown only). This makes the kit invisible to Claude's auto-invocation, which is intentional — kits don't contain agent instructions.
- Kit SKILL.md is a plain markdown description of what the kit contains and when to use it.
- Validation skips frontmatter checks for kits.
- The `dependencies` field in `skill.json` is the kit's primary content — it lists the skills the kit installs.

### Recommended Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | string | Short summary. Shown in search results and the web catalog. Keep under 200 chars. |
| `keywords` | string[] | Searchable category slugs. Include at least one canonical slug (see Section 3). |
| `authors` | string[] | Author names/emails (e.g., `["Jane Doe <jane@acme.com>"]`) |
| `license` | string | SPDX identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `repository` | string | Source repository URL |
| `homepage` | string | Homepage URL |
| `dependencies` | object | Other skills required at runtime (see Section 4) |
| `devDependencies` | object | Skills needed only for development |
| `systemDependencies` | object | External CLIs/runtimes required (see Section 4) |
| `$schema` | string | JSON Schema URL for validation |
| `forked_from` | object | Auto-set by `happyskills fork` — do not set manually |

### Complete Example

```json
{
  "name": "deploy-aws",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Deploy applications to AWS using ECS and CloudFormation",
  "authors": ["Jane Doe <jane@acme.com>"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": "https://github.com/acme/deploy-aws",
  "keywords": ["deployment", "aws", "cloud", "devops"],
  "dependencies": {
    "acme/aws-auth": "^1.0.0",
    "acme/s3-utils": "^2.1.0"
  },
  "systemDependencies": {
    "aws": {
      "description": "AWS CLI v2",
      "version": ">=2.0.0",
      "check": "aws --version",
      "install": {
        "darwin": "brew install awscli",
        "linux": "curl -s https://awscli.amazonaws.com/install | bash",
        "win32": "msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Kit Example

```json
{
  "name": "_kit-react-fullstack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "kit",
  "description": "Full-stack React development kit with UI, database, and deployment skills",
  "keywords": ["kit"],
  "dependencies": {
    "acme/react": "^1.0.0",
    "acme/shadcn": "^2.0.0",
    "acme/postgresql": "^1.5.0"
  }
}
```

### Minimal Example (Unpublished / Local)

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Short description of what this skill does",
  "keywords": []
}
```

## 3. Keyword System

### Canonical Category Slugs

The HappySkills registry recognizes these slugs for filtering and discovery in the web catalog:

| Slug | Category |
|---|---|
| `deployment` | Deployment & release automation |
| `database` | Databases & migrations |
| `security` | Security & secret scanning |
| `ai` | AI / ML |
| `api` | APIs & integrations |
| `monitoring` | Monitoring & observability |
| `testing` | Testing & QA |
| `devops` | DevOps & CI/CD |
| `cloud` | Cloud infrastructure |
| `analytics` | Analytics & data |

**Best practice**: Include at least one canonical slug so the skill appears in the right filter category. Additional custom keywords are allowed.

---

## 4. Dependency Management

### Skill Dependencies (`dependencies`)

Other HappySkills skills required at runtime. Uses `owner/name` format with semver ranges:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "acme/aws-auth": "^1.0.0",
    "acme/s3-utils": "~2.1.0"
  }
}
```

**Semver range syntax:**

| Range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `^1.2.0` | Compatible: >=1.2.0, <2.0.0 |
| `~1.2.0` | Patch-level: >=1.2.0, <1.3.0 |
| `>=1.0.0` | At least 1.0.0 |
| `1.2.0` | Exact version |
| `*` | Any version |

Dependencies are automatically resolved and installed by HappySkills when the skill is installed.

### System Dependencies (`systemDependencies`)

External CLIs or runtimes the skill requires (not managed by HappySkills — user installs manually):

```json
{
  "systemDependencies": {
    "docker": {
      "description": "Docker Engine",
      "version": ">=20.0.0",
      "check": "docker --version",
      "install": {
        "darwin": "brew install --cask docker",
        "linux": "apt install docker.io",
        "win32": "winget install Docker.DockerDesktop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry has:
- `description` — human-readable name
- `version` — minimum version constraint
- `check` — command to verify installation
- `install` — platform-specific install commands. **Always include all three platforms:**

| Key | Platform |
|-----|----------|
| `darwin` | macOS |
| `linux` | Linux |
| `win32` | Windows |

If the install command for a platform is known, include it. If the tool is not available or the install method is unknown for a platform, set the value to a message explaining the situation:

```json
"install": {
  "darwin": "brew install mytool",
  "linux": "apt install mytool",
  "win32": "Not supported on Windows"
}
```

### Dev Dependencies (`devDependencies`)

Same format as `dependencies`, but only installed with the `--dev` flag. Use for skills needed during development only.

---

## 5. Naming Conventions

### Skill Name (in `skill.json`)

- Lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores
- Must start with a letter or digit
- Pattern: `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$/`
- Examples: `deploy-aws`, `git_helpers`, `test-runner`
- Invalid: `Deploy-AWS`, `my skill`, `_private`, `-bad`

### Full Identifier (in Registry)

Format: `owner/name` (e.g., `acme/deploy-aws`)

- `owner` is a workspace slug
- Workspace types: `personal` (one per user) or organizational
- When publishing, workspace is determined by:
  1. `--workspace` flag (if provided)
  2. Single workspace → auto-selected
  3. Multiple → prefer `personal` type
  4. Fall back to first in list

---

## 6. Lock Files

**Auto-generated by HappySkills** — never edit manually.

| Scope | Location |
|---|---|
| Project | `skills-lock.json` (in the project root directory, next to `.claude/`) |
| Global | `~/.claude/skills-lock.json` |

**Key rules:**
- Commit lock files to version control for reproducible installs
- Regenerated on: first install, upgrade, `install --fresh`, or manual skill.json dependency changes
- If lock file exists, HappySkills uses it directly and skips resolution

---

## 7. Publishing Checklist

Before publishing a skill:

1. **skill.json is complete** — `name`, `version`, `description`, and `keywords` are set
2. **SKILL.md exists** — HappySkills validates its presence
3. **Version is bumped** — use `happyskills bump patch|minor|major` before publishing
4. **Dependencies are published** — all skills in `dependencies` must be published to the registry first
5. **No secrets** — `.env`, credentials, and sensitive files are automatically excluded
6. **Size limit** — total skill content must be under 50MB
7. **Visibility** — skills are **private by default** (workspace only). Pass `--public` to make the skill visible in the public catalog. Always confirm with the user before publishing publicly.

**Auto-excluded from publishing:**
```
node_modules, .git, .env, .env.*, .DS_Store, .tmp, *.log
```

## 9. Forbidden Characters in Frontmatter

Certain characters in YAML frontmatter values break the parser or skill discovery, causing skills to be silently ignored. The full table of 10 forbidden characters, safe characters, examples, and the scanning rule are defined in [skill-authoring.md § 3 — Forbidden Characters in Frontmatter Values](skill-authoring.md). That is the authoritative reference — always consult it when writing or reviewing frontmatter.

## 10. Authoring Checklist — HappySkills Complete Skill

When creating a new skill for HappySkills, ensure you produce:

- [ ] `SKILL.md` — follows Claude Code spec (frontmatter + content, see `skill-authoring.md`)
- [ ] `skill.json` — valid manifest with `name`, `version`, `description`, `keywords`
- [ ] `description` in both files — skill.json description for registry search, SKILL.md description for Claude auto-invocation (they serve different purposes and can differ)
- [ ] Keywords include at least one canonical slug
- [ ] Dependencies declared if the skill relies on other published skills
- [ ] System dependencies declared if external CLIs are required
- [ ] Skill name is lowercase-with-hyphens, matching the directory name
- [ ] Version starts at `0.1.0` for new skills
